# Mine-Detection
## Overview
This project utilizes a Logistic Regression model to classify sonar signals as either rock ('R') or mine ('M'). The classification is based on the SONAR dataset, which comprises 60 numerical features derived from sonar signals. The model is built using scikit-learn and its performance is evaluated on both training and test datasets.

## Dataset
The dataset, SONAR.csv, consists of 208 samples, each containing 60 feature columns and a single label column.

'R' denotes a rock.
'M' denotes a mine.
